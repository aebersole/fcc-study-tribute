# fcc-study-tribute

FCC self study project 1, Tribute site

So, what is this for? This project was created for challenge 1 on the Free Code Camp website. When I initially started on my journey to becoming a developer this was the first project I ever created from scratch.

I know it's full of things that could/should be changed, but I leave it this way as a progress report.  It shows me where I started and hey, it works.
